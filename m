Hi,

There is at least 3 issues with the packed attribute:
1) at parsing time, types attributes are not applied to the
   corresponding symbol,
2) the size calculation must take the attribute in account,
3) the linearization of memory access must be adapted to be able
   to access unaligned members otherwise the check access complain
   loudly.

Sorry, I don't have much time for this now but at first sight your patch
seems on the right track. I can look at it more closely this WE but
meanwhile I've pushed a branch 'packed' on
	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/devel/sparse/sparse-dev.git

This branch contains an unfinished patches but it should more or less
handle the points 1) & 2) and circumvent point 3) by disabling access
checking for bitfields.

I hope this will help you,
