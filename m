I don't agree with this point of view. Sub-options are option's parameters,
they have their own context and each options can have it's own rules for
parsing its parameters.
But yes, some options can have the same effect than some other, more longish,
option with some parameters.

I'm certainly concerned by hidden complexity and the lack of flexibility
that could result from trying to force everything in the same mold.

Yes, sure. What I mean is that these strings and their effect are specific
to the option '-std' and as such should be better handled by its specfic
function (even if it's only calling a generic helper with a specific
table for the mapping version-strings / enum.

In truth, I wouldn't mind to directly handle in the core code
new options like -floop or -fstackify and new suboptions, like the
ones for -fdump-ir. It would just need a small comment saying that
they are not used by the internal backend but well by some others.

For suboptions setting some enum value, something like this is needed
anyway to avoid clashes between future definitions.

Don't worry about -Wsparse-all. It's something that should be removed.
But more importantly, it's not something that is supposed to be used
by users.

Mmmmm. It's maybe acceptable as a first step but it's not robust.
Some chaining of tables could be a beter solution.

OK, I still don't like it much but something like here below would be
more acceptable:
	struct opt_context {

		long long llval;
		const char *str;

Or better, use an enum or some defines with some good names.

I would indeed prefer this much beter.

Yes, it's discutable but if someone currently use -ftabstop=120 it will
break its workflow.
