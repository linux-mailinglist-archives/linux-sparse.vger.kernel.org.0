:-D 

OK, so let's imagine there is a bug (perhaps an off-by-one, say)
that results in some IR _not_ being removed properly, will this
test catch that? Does it matter? why not?

Given that you don't provide an '*.expected' file, adding the
following to the test won't guarantee to catch that bug either,
but would hopefully increase the odds. (this assumes that the
pre-optimization pass IR contains 'shl', 'or', 'lsr' and 'and',
of course).

;-P

So, imagine you didn't know the inner workings of the
optimization code, looking at the test text alone, would
you understand why the test asserts what it does?
(The input IR to the algorithm doesn't have an 'and', right?)

[Similar comment about other email on patch #2, the input IR
doesn't have an 'lsr', right?]

OK, I promise not to comment further on this series! ;-)
