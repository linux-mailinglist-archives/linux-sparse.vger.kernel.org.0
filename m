This case, yes. And I suppose will solves the problem Song had.
But, for example, none of the select simplifications I posted
yesterday (not the 'move-everything-up', of course) have any effect
on v5.10-rc1. I mean, I'm sure it they have some effect on the
generated code but not on the context imbalance warnings (or any
other warning).

Yes, but the branch simplifications depend on the simplifications
that can be made on the condition. For the moment there is a focus
on select because it often happens when the condition is simple but
for these context imbalance the general case is something like:
	stuff
	if (arbitrary condition)
		take lock
	do other stuff
	if (same arbitrary condition)
		release lock

and the problem is (at least) twofold (but partially related):
1) recognize that the second condition is the same as the first one
2) avoid that partial optimizations of the first condition 'leak'
   into the common part because this often inhibits doing 1)
   [Sorry, if this is not very clear. I need to find some small
    examples to illustrate this].

When the condition is very simple, it is converted into a select
but very often it's more complex, involves a memory access and/or
some function calls or some asm.

Yes, sure, I think it's in general inevitable. But I think that for the
if-conversion here it wouldn't be much of a problem because, in itself,
it doesn't create other 'functional'/value-related simplifications.
It only may create an empty BB that can then be simplified away with
some branch simplifications. Maybe I'm just an optimist.

But sure, it's hard to predict exactly the effect. I should experiment
a bit to see the impact on quality, complexity and time.
