Yes. Obviously we're limited in that we no longer check for
out-of-bounds accesses on bitfields, but it at least produces the
correct sizes for structures, and avoids the warnings that I was running
into.

Overall, I think the changes in that branch are solid, and look correct
to me.

I'm not sure what all the limitations are of having it produce incorrect
load/store operations that don't work with the packed bitfields.. but at
least for the code I was checking, it seems to be correct now.

Thanks,
Jake
