So our operations people dug into this, and it looks to be the default
for Debian and possibly the upstream Debian too. From the ticket:
  >    We don't explicitly set dkim_sign_headers in our exim.conf, so 
according to the docs, this defaults to the macro _DKIM_SIGN_HEADERS

I think this is now fixed, will re-send later.
