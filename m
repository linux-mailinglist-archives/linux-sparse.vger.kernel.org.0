Yes, and it would anyway need more than a simple "unsigned int qual"
because attributes (and alignment via _Alignas()) are also concerned.
But I don't think an additional argument is needed: merging the
modifiers, alignment and AS can be done inside find_identifier()
itself, in the recursive part. This would make it a little less ugly.

Hehe, this third possibility is kinda tempting but for once the
standard seems quite clear to me (the grammar clearly allow it,
why it should then be ignored at the semantic level?).

I'll look at this in the next days.
