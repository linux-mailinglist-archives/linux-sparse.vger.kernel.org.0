I think the false positive is kind of unavoidable there. Detecting
such a case can be equivalent to the turing halting problem, which is
impossible to have a perfect rule or algrothium.

Do you want such a line in the final patch as well? Seems worth it.

Yes, I applied in my local git repo smoothly. Just waiting for the
