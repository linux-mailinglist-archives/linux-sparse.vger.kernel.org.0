Oleg pointed out to me that my email is not entirely clear :)

My email does not mean at all that I moved the utility to a separate
repository. I made a proof-of-concept.

Don't get me wrong, I don't mind renaming the utility. This is a good
short term solution but to be honest I don't like the name 'sparse-sindex'
because it is very long. Can we think of something shorter ?

Also, could you tell us more about your plan for future releases ?
How do you plan to split the repository ?
