Could be both:
 * if it's inlined, then its users can deduce its locking signature.
 * if it's not inlined, then the locking signature must be given in
   in the prototype (with __acquires(), __releases() or __must_hold()).

It's possible indeed. In general, conditional locking can't be statically
checked. The problem is undecidable and sparse doesn't try to check.
What sparse is checking is that all paths are 'balanced.

So, with code like:
	if (cond)
		lock();
	do_stuff;
	if (cond)
		unlock();

sparse will probably have problems. It's possible that everything id fine
if the condition is known and the remaining of the code is simple enough
but most often you will have a warning about context imbalance.

The way to avoid any problem is to write instead:

	if (cond) {
		lock();
		do_stuff;
		unlock();
	} else {
		do_stuff;
	}

which is not too bad when do_stuff can be put in a separate function,
inlined or not.

__acquire() & __release() should only be used by locking primitives.

In truth, it won't matter because the 'context' argument is only used
as a kind of documentation. The general use is to use it like the
argument to one of the lock function: as a pointer.


If needed, I can look more concretely at the problems here later
this evening but it will help a lot if would have:
* a tree with the code in question
* the config that is used (but I suspect it doesn't matter much here).
