CC-ing linux-sparse

We are seeing a lock context imbalance warning which we can't get rid
of after applying a patch moving locking around across function boundaries.

For context see:

Hm could be it...

To be honnest I'm not sure, these seem counterproductive. If you are
indicating you are acquiring X but lock Y the next line it feels like we
are fighting the tool instead of letting it help us.

Should it have a "&" here?
