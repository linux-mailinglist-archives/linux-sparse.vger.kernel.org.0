I hope this message finds you well. My name is Lena Arvidsson and I'm from Sweden. I am writing to you today to request a pen pal friendship. I have always been fascinated by the idea of having a pen pal, and I believe that it would be a great opportunity to learn about new cultures and exchange ideas with someone from a different part of the world.If you are open to the idea, I would love to exchange letters and get to know you better. We could talk about anything and everything, from our daily lives to our interests and hobbies. I believe that this could be a truly enriching experience for both of us, and I look forward to hearing back from you.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,

Lena
