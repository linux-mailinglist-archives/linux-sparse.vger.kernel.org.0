It's just that in my experience, in these situation with context
imbalance, very often 'something' had to move up, just before the
'if' where the imbalance is created.

I totally agree with this.

Yes, once the SEL(SEL(x,C,0),C,0) is handled this all simplify to
	.L0:
		 <entry-point>
		 select.32   %r6 <- %arg1, $0xffffffff, $0
		 cbr         %arg1, .L6, .L4
	.L4:
		 call        spin_lock
		 # call      %r4 <- errno, %r1
		 call        spin_unlock
		 br          .L6
	.L6:
		 ret.32      %r6

but to me, this seems a very very special case, so not much interesting.

Absolutely. I've often observed that it inhibits other simplifications
related to conditionals. And, even when it doesn't, I think that many
select simplifications would already be handled at SETxx + CBR level
(like your previous SEL(x,x,0)).

So, yes, the if-conversion is a very valuable simplification but I also
think it's done too early. And there are some other simplifications that
are valuable but only if not done too early (sorry, I've no concrete
examples at hand). It slowly begins time to organize the optimizations
in several phases.
