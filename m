Ok.

Looking around the config options, there _are_ systems with ISA slots,
but it's not the old Jensen one. It's apparently some evaluation
boards but also the "AlphaPC64" one.

So we do want CONFIG_ISA for alpha, even if not Jensen.

(I forget which alpha I had. For some reason I want to think I had an
EISA machine and probably Jensen. Maybe upgraded to a 164 later?)

Ouch. Without having some kind of bisection, I guess we'll never know.
And I assume it's not really been tested since, so it could be
multiple reasons, including compiler updates causing dodgy code to not
work etc etc.

Can you send me your Jensen config?

I do not see why you should be using that horrible __EXERN_INLINE. It
will cause gcc to sometimes not inline at all, and not generate the
out-of-line body either.

Sometimes that is what you want: you want to generate one single body
of the function, and particularly one that is _different_ from the
inlining case (ie for inlining you want to do the simple thing, for
out-of-line you do something fancier).

But that isn't the case here, so this looks like a workaround for
something else. But this code does end up using preprocessor
concatenation etc, so I might be missing some case.
