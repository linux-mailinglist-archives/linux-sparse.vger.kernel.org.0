Nice. Thank you.

Yes, it was posted on the ML (archived as
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-sparse/20210906042111.lhoq7egtpmw3jcv6@mail/ )
I used to be unsubscribed from various kernel.org mailing list relatively
often (but I think I haven't been the last 2 years or so, at least from the
sparse ML).

I vaguely remember there was some complications for switch labels but I can't
remember the details.

I tend more and more to use errors only for the cases where Sparse can't
handle the following correctly anymore.

Yes, I'm aware of this but IIRC the motivation was related to the mixing
of statements and declarations. The next standard is planned for 2023,
meanwhile I don't have a strong opinion about this error/warning (but
I'm very fine making things coherent between switch and regular labels).
