Thanks.  IIRC you were actually getting the failures from the other 
thread, so I think this is OK, but jus for everyone else:

Unfortunately there's a few more variables than just the GCC version, 
this depends on the binutils version (and IIUC the binutils version GCC 
was compiled with) and how Linux was configured.  I was testing with a 
V=1 build to make sure "-march=rv64imafdc_zicsr_zifence" showed up, it 
should be the same for all files so I was just poking one.
