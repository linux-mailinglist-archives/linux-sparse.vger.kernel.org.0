OK, I see. I'll add __builtin_ia32_pause() now and I'll look at
__atomic_load_n(), __sync_add_and_fetch() and friends soon.

It's always possible to use -Wno-non-pointer-null and
-Wno-old_-style-definition but ...

Well, one of the key characteristic of __bitwise is that it creates new,
distinct, incompatible types and it is very much used as such. For example,
in the kernel the 6 {be,le}{16,32,64} are maybe the most used but there
are about 100 other bitwise types that are defined (like poll_t or
pci_power_t) just to have a distinct type.

So, for the problem with rte_be32_t & ovs_be32, the solutions should be
to have a common definition, either via a macro or a typedef. Not an
easy thing with external libraries.
