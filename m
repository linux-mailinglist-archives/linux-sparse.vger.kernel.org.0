Test-case:

	$ cat -n DECL_POS.c
	     1	void
	     2	 *       ptr,
	     3	 *   (*  fptr  ) (int),
	     4	 *       ary[2];
	     5
	     6	struct T {
	     7	 void
	     8	  *      mptr1[],
	     9	  *      mptr2[];
	    10	 int     dummy;
	    11	};
	    12
	    13	static void func(struct T *t)
	    14	{
	    15		__builtin_offsetof(typeof(*t), dummy);
	    16	}

Note that all variables/members are defined at column 10.

However, before this patch

	$ ./sparse DECL_POS.c
	DECL_POS.c:2:2: warning: symbol 'ptr' was not declared. Should it be static?
	DECL_POS.c:3:2: warning: symbol 'fptr' was not declared. Should it be static?
	DECL_POS.c:4:2: warning: symbol 'ary' was not declared. Should it be static?
	DECL_POS.c:8:3: error: flexible array member 'mptr1' is not last
	DECL_POS.c:9:3: error: flexible array member 'mptr2' is not last

every reported position is wrong.

This is because the users of declarator() do alloc_symbol(token->pos),
but the current token is not necessarily the ident found later in the
declarator() paths.

With this patch:

	$ ./sparse DECL_POS.c
	DECL_POS.c:2:10: warning: symbol 'ptr' was not declared. Should it be static?
	DECL_POS.c:3:10: warning: symbol 'fptr' was not declared. Should it be static?
	DECL_POS.c:4:10: warning: symbol 'ary' was not declared. Should it be static?
	DECL_POS.c:8:10: error: flexible array member 'mptr1' is not last
	DECL_POS.c:9:10: error: flexible array member 'mptr2' is not last

See also the fixes in validation/{function-redecl,reserved}.c, some
of the old positions in the check-error-start/end blocks were wrong.

TODO: there are more users of users of declarator() which should
probably be updated the same way.

NOTE: unlike external_declaration(), declaration_list() doesn't check
ident != NULL, so ./sparse doesn't complain about "struct { int; };",
this should probably be fixed.
