Wee brain dump in response, dunno if I am missing your point & if so
please correct me...

hmm, gnu tools meetings - are bystanders like myself allowed to attend?
I doubt I'd have anything interesting to say, but given the names it
seems like a good thing to keep an eye on.

To be blunt, if the toolchain people are not clear on what the craic is
with how extensions interact how are the rest of us supposed to get it?
In my naivety I'd expect that sort of distinction to be clear from the
spec docs...

By kconfig based, do you mean w/ the sort of thing I was messing with in
this patchset:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20221006173520.1785507-2-conor@kernel.org/

I really don't like having ifdef-ery, seems to just result in missed
conditions as the recent Zicbom stuff has shown. Since it's thinking-
out-loud o clock - while its not my place to make decisions, I think for
future extension patchsets I am going to try and push people towards as
few conditionally defined variables etc as possible.
I think you said the other day that things like __riscv_zmmul are
conditionally defined based on the toolchain supporting them right?
That'd make sense since older toolchains wouldn't know they existed...
Anyways, what I meant by all that is that instead of ifdef-ery, I'd
rather IS_ENABLED() with unconditionally {defined,defined} variables so
that we don't end up with little pockets of code that end up missed
because of some overlapping extension ifdef hell.

Upstream seems to have a lot of people that run bells & whistles
toolchains with the new & shiny toys available or the standard
riscv-gnu-toolchain builds of something significantly older. I'd just be
a little worried about potentially having poor coverage of some odd
combinations of things with #ifdefs.

Could you explain this one a little more? Even after reading that issue
I am a little unsure what you mean by different string->behaviour
mappings. Something along the lines of some Zfoo extension could deny
user-mode software from using certain instructions but in kernel-land we
would want to (or need to?) use those instructions?

Do we ignore march, or could we just chop the string after the single
letter extensions? I am not up on how much of (if any) of the march
string is/would ever be used. I had a quick look at target-riscv.c and
it seems we just use it to predefine __riscv_foo & set xlen. Does that
mean if we used ifdef-ery or IS_ENABLED to gate features we could avoid
having to use new __riscv_foo symbols and therefore not have to
predefine them in sparse? Maybe I am misunderstanding - something,
something out of my depth...

Yeah, it'd be nice to avoid having to deal with new march updates
constantly, especially since we cannot expect everyone to run ToT sparse
either. The current situation makes me wonder who outside the pair of us
is even running sparse in the first place?

Thanks,
Conor.
