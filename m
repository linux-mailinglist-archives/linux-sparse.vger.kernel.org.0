I think I may even have already this in an half-polished form.

This, should already be done (by yourself, many years ago).

Yes.

This shouldn't be a big problem since we already have the dominance
tree (but it's not yet updated when there is changes n the CFG).
OTOH, the memops simplification creates invalid phi-nodes which
indirectly creates all sort of problems. I've several fixes for this
but none I'm really happy with.

No no, it's certainly more than a few hours of work but it's also not
an immense task. Of course, the devil is always in the details.

There is also the option of explicitly handling conditional contexts.
I did maybe 6 months ago, in 2 or 3 different ways. It worked well,
and would probably solve the problem here but:
* it needs new annotations
* it's OK when the condition is simple ( = 0 or != 0), it could be
  adapted for some others (like, for example, >= 0) but more general
  condition would become hard to handle (the annotations needs to know
  about the condition).
* the benefits were disappointing because, in most cases I saw, it
  displaced the problem to somewhere else where a 'real' optimization
  was needed. This is why I stopped to look at it.

But so, yes, what you propose here makes a lot of sense and would be
very valuable. I'll take a look at it soon (but my stack is already so
full that I'm quite reluctant to begin anything new (I currently have
208 topic branches with 120 of them being valid, interesting seriess
waiting some polishing, validation and patch description :( ).
