But isn't a lot of code written to explicitly support this, with an
argument or some other condition selecting between the locked mode
or the unlocked mode?

I agree with all this but I think the situation is not so clear cut.
I've made a few examples, oversimplified, totally made-up but
representative of the situations with the context tracking.

	void take_lock(void) __attribute__((context(x, 0, 1)));
	void drop_lock(void) __attribute__((context(x, 1, 0)));
	void minor(void);
	void major(void);
	int complex_cond(void);
	
This one is fine for Sparse
	static inline int cond_lock1(void)
	{
		if (complex_cond()) {
			take_lock();
			minor();
			return 1;
		}
		return 0;
	}
	static void ok1(void)
	{
		int cond = cond_lock1();
		if (cond) {
			major();
			drop_lock();
		}
	}
It produces the following:
	ok1:
		call.32     %r1 <- complex_cond
		cbr         %r1, .L1, .L5
	.L1:
		call        take_lock
		context     1
		call        minor
		# call      %r3 <- cond_lock1
		call        major
		call        drop_lock
		context     -1
		br          .L5
	.L5:
		ret
Good.

The next one corresponds to the situation Song Liu reported
	static inline int cond_lock2(void)
	{
		if (!complex_cond())
			return -1;
	
		take_lock();
		minor();
		return 0;
	}
	static int okish(void)
	{
		int cond = cond_lock2();
		if (cond)
			return 0;
		major();
		drop_lock();
		return 1;
	}

Sparse currently produces the following:
	okish:
		call.32     %r6 <- complex_cond
		select.32   %r8 <- %r6, $0, $0xffffffff
		cbr         %r6, .L8, .L9
	.L8:
		call        take_lock
		context     1
		call        minor
		br          .L9
	.L9:
		# call      %r8 <- cond_lock2
		seteq.32    %r11 <- %r8, $0
		cbr         %r6, .L11, .L12
	.L11:
		call        major
		call        drop_lock
		context     -1
		br          .L12
	.L12:
		ret.32      %r11

Sparse complains about a context imbalance because of L8/L9.
The seteq is not merged with the select but something can be done
about it or on the conditional branch that depends on it.
I'll look at it right away.

[But from what I remember when I analyzed some of these, it's in
 similar situations that things are messy, when cond_lock() is
 slightly more complex and partial simplifications begins to mix
 things from the surrounding blocks].


The one that really annoys me is this one. It's very simple and, as
far as I know, quite common in the kernel but kinda hopeless.
	static void ko(int cond)
	{
		if (cond)
			take_lock();
		major();
		if (cond)
			drop_lock();
	}

It produces the following:
	ko:
		cbr         %arg1, .L14, .L15
	.L14:
		call        take_lock
		context     1
		br          .L15
	.L15:
		call        major
		cbr         %arg1, .L16, .L17
	.L16:
		call        drop_lock
		context     -1
		br          .L17
	.L17:
		ret

There is no select, no seteq/setne, no complex condition, nothing.
It's an idealization but I think that a lot of code involving
conditional locks boils down to this and as I said is quite common.

What do we want to do about this? I don't think there is nothing that
can be done except warning or duplicating .L15, making it as if the
code would have been written as:
	static void ko(int cond)
	{
		if (cond) {
			take_lock();
			major();
			drop_lock();
		} else {
			major();
		}
	}
It's doable of course but ... well, I don't think we want to do this.
