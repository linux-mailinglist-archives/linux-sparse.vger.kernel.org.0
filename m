Nice!
This is definitely worth including, but I'm out of my depth here.
Some ideas below in case they're helpful.

Coming from a place of ignorance, when should I use sparse vs smatch?
Is there an existing consensus on this, or is that a controversial question?

I assume other newcomers like me will have the same question and be
unsure if they should spend time learning about sparse.
In general, I think the main point of this page is to explain both
what the tools do and give an idea of _why_ someone might want to
consider using them.

Personal preference:
I'd personally put this up before we go into details about each tool.

E.g. perhaps like

In addition to testing a running kernel, one can also analyze kernel
source code directly (the whole tree or specific files) using **static
analysis** tools.
Some tools commonly used in the kernel are ...
