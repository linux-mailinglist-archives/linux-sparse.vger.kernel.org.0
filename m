This is not an alternative for me because the lock needs to hold
during the "some_condition". (More background is that we dealing with
data structures here and cannot allow a get() from this data
structures during "some_condition", the lock is preventing this)
It is the refcount code which causes trouble here [0] and I think the
refcount code should never call the unlock() procedure in any
condition and leave it to the caller to call unlock() in any case.

I to'ed (hope to get more attention to this) more people related to
lib/refcount.c implementation (provided by get_maintainers.pl -f).

If we change the refcount code to _never_ calling unlock() for the
specific lock, then all those foo_and_lock_bar() functions can be
annotated with "__acquires()". This should also end in the same code?
For me it looks like the current implementation of refcount.c is fine
except sparse cannot figure out what's going on and maybe a reason to
change the specific handling to the mentioned one.

I hope we will find some solution, because I don't like sparse warnings.
