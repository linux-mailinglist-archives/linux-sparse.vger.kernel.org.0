Ah sorry, it's just a misunderstanding. The context of my email wasn't
very clear. But no worries, I have absolutely no intentions to split
the repository (that would be very annoying for everybody). I was only
talking about, maybe, in some future, split the *package* at distro
level. For example, currently Debian has already 2 packages for sparse:
one, called 'sparse', with almost everything, and another one only
with 'test-inspect', called 'sparse-test-inspect'.

In any case, I don't have any precise plan, and distro packaging is
anyway something to be decided by the distros. So, if anything will
done in this direction, it will be done in collaboration of the distros
and anyone involved.

For the name, I'm also don't like 'sparse-sindex', but it would just
have been an easy way to avoid the name conflict in Debian packages
(I understand that no such conflict exist with Fedora because
'biosquid' only exists for Debian).
