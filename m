I fetched the source RPM from openSUSE and replaced the 0.6.2 tar.xz with the 
current master. After building an updating the RPM, sparse doesn't crash 
anymore.

openSUSE ships two versions of sparse [1]:
- official release: 20180324
- experimental: 0.6.2

It seems that both version are affected from this problem. The "experimental" 
version should be automatically updated after a new version of sparse is 
released. The "official release" will probably only accept patches resolving 
specific problems. If you can provide a patch against 20180324, I would try to 
write a bug report against the openSUSE package. This could save some time for 
the next person stumbling over this problem... If you provide the commit id, 
openSUSE can also decide themself whether to fix or upgrade the current 
version.

Best regards
Christian
