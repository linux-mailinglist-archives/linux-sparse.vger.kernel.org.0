If only ...

Yes, I can understand that.

As far as I understand it, -Werror has been replaced by -Wsparse-error in
2014 because sparse was mainly used with exactly the same options as the
ones used for the compiler (which is good), there was too much error
messages and people didn't want to have their build to fail (see commits
4d8811879a1c & fe57afa0b44a). So, essentially the exact opposite of what
you would like :(

-Wsparse-error is really a pain because it also turn every warning into
an error (and then exit on these errors).

It should indeed be possible to have an exit(1) on errors but I'm very wary
of changing the current behaviour. What about something like -ffail-on-error?

I think so (but I could be very wrong). An exit on error is only useful
if the output is clean and the errors not too frequent. I think it's
often not the case.

But, if your main problem is with error messages concerning address spaces,
have you tried to simply use -Wno-address-space?

Some other error messages issued by sparse can't be disabled but most of these
are, I think, parsing or typing errors that are more or less unrecoverable.

Purely for my own curiosity, could you send me one of your log of sparse
errors?
