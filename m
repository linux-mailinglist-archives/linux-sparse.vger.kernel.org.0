Yea, this is what I couldn't figure out.

This is what I got working IFF I hacked the symbol to say MOD_PACKED.
But I couldn't figure out (1) so I got stuck.

Yea I figured something would break here, I was basically mostly
interested in handling the size.

Ok thanks! I'll take a look at the packed branch, that should help me.

Perhaps I can take a stab at (3) based on whats in that branch.
