Not exactly, but I confess that currently I'm focusing a lot on the
'*false* context imbalance' (those I can see in the C code or in
the IR that should be OK but sparse warning on them nevertheless). 
I've not a very clear idea of how much of those warnings are real
(but I'm begin to think more and more than most are real).

By far, the most common cause of these false warnings is a CBR-CBR
on the same condition that is not simplified away because the second
one is not empty.

Yes, I agree for both points.

Yes, indeed, it's arbitrary because it's the only case I'm interested
about for these 'false context imbalance'. But no worries, as explained
in the patch description, it's not my intention to merge this, certainly
not as-is. It's more a kind of experiment to play with, a kind of
exploratory tool.

Yes, I'll add this (but I'm not sure to have anything significant
not related to emptying a BB ending with a CBR).

I don't think I understand this. In the case of an UNOP, sinking it
increase the liveness and decrease the liveness of the output, so
it should not matter much. In the case of an BINOP or select, sinking
it will decrease the liveness of the unique output but increase the
liveness of the inputs. So, it seems to me that sinking would
globally increase the liveness (contrary to moving up instructions).
Am I missing something?
