Yes, my explanation is completely wrong. The warning is indeed just
about sizeof() != offset() and I added because it seemed odd to me
but ...

Yes, indeed, it's perfectly normal. I'll drop this patch.

Adding this warning by default annoys me slightly because it will
add 5700+ warnings to the 18000 already present and I think sparse
is already underused because it is very/too noisy. But I guess that
most occurrences come from a few macros and thus should be easy to
get rid off.

This accounts for only 432 occurences of sizeof(flex-array),
leaving 5287 other ones.

Well, yes, for my part, I find the number of nested flexible arrays a
bit worrying and much less sensical than the sizeof but .. live and see.
