(sorry for the delay responding, took a week off last week; spent a

No worries, we'll get all this sorted.  There's also
linux-toolchains@vger.kernel.org that can help with spooky toolchain
behavior.

I suspect this is what's causing a flood of objtool warnings when we
specify different instruction schedules via -march= (such as via
CONFIG_MATOM), which are hiding some of the actual codegen bugs
objtool has found in LLVM that we still need to fix.

I was looking at the HAVE_ARCH_BUG implementation in
arch/x86/include/asm/bug.h 2 weeks ago, and got the sinking feeling
that we'll probably need labels in C code, then asm goto to ensure
that control flow doesn't get folded in an unexpected way and which
I'd imagine might help avoid the costs of a full compiler barrier
(i.e. reloading all pointed-to values across it).

I'll follow up more with Josh on IRC on some ideas for different
approaches.  Having 0day bot test Josh's branches is very much
appreciated.

I noticed in that report and
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/202201190702.XNSXrMTK-lkp@intel.com/
that gcc-9 was used.  I wonder if %= has been fixed in gcc-10+? Have
there been other reports with gcc-10+ for my patch?

Boris' case of xfrm_output_resume is yet a third case; Boris, what
version of gcc did you spot that with?

If this is fixed in gcc-10, then we can probably add a comment with a
FIXME link to the issue or commit to replace __COUNTER__ with %= one
day.  If not, then we can probably come up with a reduced test case
for the GCC devs to take a look at, then add the FIXME comment to
kernel sources.

I'm more confident that we can remove the `volatile` keyword (I was
thinking about adding a new diagnostic to clang to warn that volatile
is redundate+implied for asm goto or inline asm that doesn't have
outputs) though that's not the problem here and will probably generate
some kernel wide cleanup before we could enable such a flag.  Perhaps
there are known compiler versions that still require the keyword for
those cases for some reason.

Very much YES to both points.  Will include those in the commit
message for whatever we come up with for the final solution.
