Mmm yes, I see.

I was simply thinking doing this directly. In the case of a simple
'diamond' (with the top and bottom CBR on the same conditional),
there is no dependency/dominance problems and it's enough to change
the target of the BR in the two side BBs.

I think the general solution is to look at the dominance tree:
if there is another conditional branch with the same condition and which
dominates the current, then it must be safe to duplicate because it
can be simplified away anyway. Otherwise, I would prefer to avoid
duplicating anything without some cost/benefit guarantee.
