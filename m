I did find one bug, in your step (3), you have a check against
info->packed on symbol.c:162 in lay_out_struct, but nothing ever set the
packed value. I think you just need to initialized info->packed from
sym_packed at the top of examine_struct_union_type, i.e.


---
diff --git i/symbol.c w/symbol.c
index 4a654eea9cd0..5a2e0fcd1532 100644

        void (*fn)(struct symbol *, struct struct_union_info *);

+       info.packed = sym->packed;
+
        fn = advance ? lay_out_struct : lay_out_union;
        FOR_EACH_PTR(sym->symbol_list, member) {
                if (member->ctype.base_type == &autotype_ctype) {

Without this change, bitfield access checks aren't actually suppressed
properly.

Thanks,
