Note that if the condition is complex and involves memory etc, it's
generally actually a bug in the kernel.

Because if it could possibly change between the lock taking and
releasing, you are now broken.

So I wouldn't want to accept code like that _anyway_. Any complex
conditional needs to be written as

     lock = complex_conditional;
     if (lock)
          take lock
     do other stuff
     if (lock)
          release lock

and if sparse handles _that_ case well, then all is ok.

If sparse complains about the fragile "repeat complex conditional that
couldn't be simplified to show that it was obviously identical", then
that's actually a _good_ thing.

Because we want to complain about stuff where it's not obviously clear
that the conditional is 100% the same.

Now, even in the above, if we'd want sparse to say that is ok, then
we'd actually need to make the context tracking itself able to deal
with "conditional on this pseudo", which it doesn't do right now.

So right now it requires that much simpler case where you actually end
up not ever having that shared case in the middle at all, and the
simplification really ends up showing that the real path is really

     error = complex_conditional;
     if (error)
          return error;
     take lock
     do other stuff
     release lock

which apparently sparse now - with your simplification - can see that
the code actually ends up doing .

Which is even better.

I'd much rather have the lock context tracking show that locking is
simple, and that we don't have any code that sometimes is called
locked, and sometimes is not.

Because even if you can prove - with some kind of conditional context
tracking - that the context at least _nests_ correctly (ie you always
properly unlock something you locked), that isn't actually the big
problem. The big problem really is "why did that 'do-other-stuff'
sometimes run without locking, and sometimes with locking?"

So the lock context tracking is fairly inflexible on purpose. It's
_meant_ to not just do "unlock matches a lock" matching. It's meant to
also track "ok, there is no odd 'sometimes locked, sometimes not'
code".
