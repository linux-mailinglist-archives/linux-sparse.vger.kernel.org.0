Oh no.

Doing what gcc or clang does seems like a smart thing to do.

fstat is more or less necessary anyway to allocate just enough memory
for 1 read. fstat is not a problem, read is (and subsequent parsing).

gcc does

	open "/" + "whatever between quotes"
	fstat

so that "1.h" and "./1.h" differ

	https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/master/libcpp/files.c#L377

clang does better:

	"./" + "whatever between quotes"
	open
	fstat
	normalise pathname via readlink /proc/*/fd

I think it is quite hard to break something with double inclusion
without trying to actually break stuff. Macros has to be token
for token identical or compiler warn. Types definition too.
Function prototypes and so on.

This is how I found half of the exception list.

The "no leading ./ in includes is trivially enforced with checkpatch.pl
or even grep! And it will optimise the build now that gcc behaviour has
been uncovered.

Include guards aren't without problems.

We have at least 1 identical include guard in the tree for two
completely unrelated headers (allmodconfig of some fringe arch found it)
Nobody complains because only defconfigs are run apparently.

Developer can typo it disabling double inclusion.

	#ifndef FOO_H
	#define FOO_h
	#endif

I've seen a reference to a static checker checking for such stuff
so this problem exists.

Invisibly broken inlcude guards (see qla2xxx patch in the series).
